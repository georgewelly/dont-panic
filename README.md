# Panic Button Application

* A short and sweet application for discrete communication with others
* Intended for use when the user cannot send messages with privacy
* Ideally set up so the user can send pre-designated whatsapp/text messages by doing different innocuous functions within the "app"
* Can be set up to share location quickly
* Intended devices: phones & wearable tech (?)
